    dt is a generic data test program used to verify proper operation of
peripherals, file systems, device drivers, or any data stream supported by the
operating system. In its' simplest mode of operation, dt writes and then
verifys its' default data pattern, then displays performance statisics and other
test parameters before exiting.  Since verification of data is performed,
dt can be thought of as a generic diagnostic tool.
